# Order Status Update Enhancement - Summary

## 🎯 What Was Added

You noticed that when order statuses are updated (e.g., from PROCESSING to SHIPPED), the system was missing important features that we had implemented for order creation. This update fixes that!

## ✅ New Features for Status Updates

### 1. Enhanced Customer Status Update Email
**Function:** `sendOrderStatusUpdateEmail()` in `app/lib/email.ts`

**Previously included:**
- Status change notification
- Order number
- Tracking number (if provided)
- Merchant business name only

**Now includes:**
- ✅ **Merchant contact information** (address, phone, email) - same as order confirmation!
- ✅ **"Track Your Order" button** linking to `/track?orderId={id}` 
- ✅ Status-specific messaging with color-coded badges
- ✅ Additional notes from status update

**Example:** When an order moves to "SHIPPED", customers get:
```
📦 Order Status: SHIPPED
🏪 Merchant Contact Info:
   📍 123 Business Street, Lagos
   📞 +234 123 456 7890
   ✉️ merchant@business.com
   
[Track Your Order Button] 👈 Links to tracking page
```

### 2. Merchant Status Update Email (NEW!)
**Function:** `sendMerchantStatusUpdateEmail()` in `app/lib/email.ts`

**Previously:** Merchants only got notifications when orders were CREATED
**Now:** Merchants get email notifications for EVERY status change!

**Email includes:**
- Status change with color-coded badge
- Customer name and order number
- Tracking information (if available)
- Status-specific messaging for merchants
- Additional notes from the update
- "View Order Details" button linking directly to the order

**Example:** When warehouse updates order to "SHIPPED":
```
🚀 Order Status Updated: SHIPPED

Order: ORD-2025-001
Customer: John Doe

This order is on its way to the customer.

Tracking: TRK-12345

[View Order Details Button]
```

### 3. Updated API Integration
**File:** `app/api/orders/[id]/route.ts`

**Enhanced merchant data fetching:**
```typescript
merchant: {
  select: {
    id: true,
    businessName: true,
    businessEmail: true,    // ⭐ NEW
    address: true,          // ⭐ NEW
    businessPhone: true     // ⭐ NEW
  }
}
```

**Complete email flow when status updates:**
1. Update order status in database ✅
2. Create status history entry ✅
3. Send customer email with:
   - Status update
   - Merchant contact info ⭐
   - Tracking link ⭐
4. Send merchant email with:
   - Status update notification ⭐
   - Customer details ⭐
   - Order link ⭐
5. Create platform notification for merchant ✅
6. Execute status-specific actions (e.g., billing for DELIVERED) ✅
