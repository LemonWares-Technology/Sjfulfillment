# Order Email Fix - Summary

## Problem
1. **Emails not being sent** when merchant creates orders for customers
2. **No success message** shown on frontend after order creation

## Root Cause Analysis
The environment variables in `.env.local` were correctly set, but the issue was:
1. Type mismatch: `shippingAddress` is stored as `JsonValue` (object) in database but email function expected `string`
2. No toast notification after successful order creation

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Type Error in Order Creation API
**File:** `app/api/orders/route.ts`
- Added conversion of `shippingAddress` from JsonValue object to formatted string before sending email
- Now correctly handles object-to-string conversion: `JSON.stringify(newOrder.shippingAddress, null, 2)`

### 2. Added Success Toast Notification
**File:** `app/components/order-modal.tsx`
- Added success toast message after order creation
- Message includes confirmation that email was sent to customer (if email provided)
- Added error toast on failure
- Added console logging for debugging:
  - "üì¶ Creating order with data..." before API call
  - "‚úÖ Order created successfully" on success
  - "‚ùå Failed to create order" on error

### 3. Enhanced Email Debugging
**File:** `app/lib/email.ts`
- Added comprehensive environment variable logging in `sendEmail()` function
- Logs show:
  - EMAIL_PROVIDER status
  - EMAIL_FROM value
  - ZEPTOMAIL_API_KEY presence and length
  - Recipient and subject for each email

## How to Test

### 1. **MUST DO FIRST: Restart Your Server**
The changes won't work until you restart:
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### 2. Create a Test Order
1. Log in as a merchant
2. Go to Orders page
3. Click "Create Order"
4. Fill in customer details (IMPORTANT: include a valid email address)
5. Add products
6. Submit the order

### 3. Check Console Logs
In your terminal, you should see:
```
üì¶ Creating order with data: { customerName: '...', customerEmail: '...', ... }
Attempting to send order confirmation email... { to: '...', orderNumber: '...', ... }
üìß sendEmail called with environment check: { EMAIL_PROVIDER: 'zeptomail', ... }
Sending email via ZeptoMail... { to: [...], subject: '...', ... }
‚úÖ ZeptoMail response status: 201
‚úÖ Email sent successfully
‚úÖ Order confirmation email sent successfully to: customer@email.com
```

### 4. Check Frontend
You should see a green success toast message:
```
Order created successfully! Confirmation email sent to customer.
```

### 5. Check Customer Inbox
The customer should receive an email with:
- Order confirmation
- Order details (items, pricing, shipping address)
- Merchant information
- SJFulfillment branding

## Troubleshooting

### If Email Still Not Sending

1. **Check terminal logs** for the exact error message
2. **Verify environment variables** are loaded:
   - Look for the log: `üìß sendEmail called with environment check`
   - Confirm `ZEPTOMAIL_API_KEY_SET: true`
   - Confirm `ZEPTOMAIL_API_KEY_LENGTH: 160`

3. **Common Issues:**
   - Server not restarted after `.env.local` changes
   - Customer email field is empty
   - ZeptoMail API key is invalid
   - Domain (sjfulfillment.com) not verified in ZeptoMail

4. **See `EMAIL_DEBUG_GUIDE.md`** for detailed troubleshooting steps

## Files Modified
1. `app/api/orders/route.ts` - Fixed shippingAddress type conversion
2. `app/components/order-modal.tsx` - Added success/error toast notifications
3. `app/lib/email.ts` - Added environment variable debugging logs

## Next Steps
1. Restart your development server
2. Create a test order with a real customer email
3. Verify email is received
4. Check logs if there are any issues

---
**Note:** The order will still be created successfully even if the email fails to send. This prevents email issues from blocking critical business operations.
