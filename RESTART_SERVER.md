# ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Restart Your Server Now!

## What happened?
The email environment variables were commented out in `.env.local`, which is why emails weren't being sent when creating orders (even though the test script worked).

## What was fixed?
âœ… Updated `.env.local` to include the email environment variables:
- `EMAIL_PROVIDER=zeptomail`
- `ZEPTOMAIL_API_KEY=...`
- `EMAIL_FROM=SJFulfillment <no-reply@sjfulfillment.com>`

## What you need to do NOW:
**Restart your Next.js development server** for the changes to take effect:

```bash
# 1. Stop the current server (press Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)

# 2. Start it again
npm run dev
```

## How to test if it works:
1. **Restart the server** (see above)
2. Log into your application as a merchant
3. Create a new order with a valid customer email
4. Check the terminal logs for:
   ```
   âœ… Order confirmation email sent successfully to: customer@email.com
   ```
5. Check the customer's inbox (and spam folder)

## Why did the test script work but not the actual orders?
- The test script (`scripts/test-email.ts`) manually loads the `.env` file using `dotenv`
- Next.js API routes don't manually load `.env` - they rely on Next.js to load it
- When `NODE_ENV=production`, Next.js only loads `.env.local` and `.env.production.local`
- Your `.env.local` had the email variables commented out!
