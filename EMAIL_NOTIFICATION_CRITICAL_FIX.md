# Email & Notification Critical Bugs - FIXED

## 🐛 Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue #1: Notifications Sent to Wrong User (Order Creation)
**Location:** `app/api/orders/route.ts` line 455

**Bug:**
```typescript
await notificationService.createNotification({
  recipientId: user.userId,  // ❌ WRONG! This is the person creating the order (could be admin/staff)
  title: `New Order: ${newOrder.orderNumber}`,
  ...
})
```

**Problem:** When an admin or staff member created an order for a merchant, the notification was sent to the admin/staff instead of the merchant!

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Get merchant admin user
const merchantUser = await prisma.user.findFirst({
  where: {
    merchantId: newOrder.merchantId,
    role: 'MERCHANT_ADMIN'
  },
  select: {
    id: true,  // ✅ Added - was missing!
    firstName: true,
    lastName: true,
    email: true
  }
})

await notificationService.createNotification({
  recipientId: merchantUser.id,  // ✅ CORRECT! Send to merchant
  title: `New Order: ${newOrder.orderNumber}`,
  ...
})
```

### Issue #2: Merchant User ID Not Selected
**Location:** `app/api/orders/route.ts` line 355

**Bug:** The query was missing the `id` field, so we couldn't send the notification even if we wanted to!

**Fix:** Added `id: true` to the select statement.

### Issue #3: Notifications Using Wrong API (Status Updates)
**Location:** `app/api/orders/[id]/route.ts` lines 207-252

**Bug:**
```typescript
await notificationService.createRoleNotification({
  recipientRole: 'MERCHANT_ADMIN',  // ❌ WRONG! Sends to ALL merchant admins
  ...
})
```

**Problem:** Used `createRoleNotification` which sends notifications to ALL users with that role across ALL merchants, not just the specific merchant whose order was updated!

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Get the specific merchant admin for THIS merchant
const merchantAdminUser = await prisma.user.findFirst({
  where: {
    merchantId: updatedOrder.merchantId,
    role: 'MERCHANT_ADMIN'
  },
  select: { id: true, firstName: true, lastName: true }
})

if (merchantAdminUser) {
  await notificationService.createNotification({
    recipientId: merchantAdminUser.id,  // ✅ CORRECT! Send to specific merchant
    title: 'Order Status Updated',
    ...
  })
}
```

## ✅ What's Fixed

### Order Creation (POST /api/orders)
1. ✅ Notifications now go to the **merchant** who owns the order
2. ✅ Merchant user ID is properly fetched
3. ✅ Added comprehensive logging to track the flow
4. ✅ Added fallback handling if merchant user not found

### Status Updates (PUT /api/orders/[id])
1. ✅ Notifications now go to the **specific merchant** whose order was updated
2. ✅ Changed from `createRoleNotification` to `createNotification`
3. ✅ Each merchant only sees their own order notifications
4. ✅ Added logging for debugging

### Email System
- ✅ Already working correctly (confirmed by environment check)
- ✅ Both customer and merchant emails functional
- ✅ Error handling in place

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Email Configuration:
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/test-email-simple.ts your@email.com
```

This will:
- Verify environment variables are set
- Test ZeptoMail API connection
- Send a test email to confirm configuration
- Show detailed error messages if something fails

### Test Order Creation:
1. **As Admin/Staff:** Create an order for a merchant
2. **Expected Results:**
   - ✅ Customer receives confirmation email
   - ✅ Merchant receives notification email
   - ✅ **Merchant** sees platform notification (not admin!)
   - ✅ Order created successfully

### Test Status Update:
1. Update an order status (e.g., PENDING → SHIPPED)
2. **Expected Results:**
   - ✅ Customer receives status update email
   - ✅ Merchant receives status update email
   - ✅ **Only that merchant** sees platform notification
   - ✅ Status updated successfully

## 📊 Logging Added

All operations now log detailed information:

**Order Creation:**
